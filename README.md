# The new NHL API 2023

About 2 weeks before the start of the NHL season, the National Hockey League began publishing a new API. 

A handful of people are actively working to document the new API and are painstakingly doing the work of discovering the new endpoints. 

This project is verification of their work. 

Ultimately being able to work with the API is the goal; building other tools and apps to drive analytics, entertain me during intermissions and generally just learn how to become a better engineer is the goal. 

## Current work in progress

As of September 30th, 2023, the work being done on this project is:

- Verify each new endpoint by adding to Postman
- Build an interface that publishes each endpoint, as well as the returned JSON

## Future work

Additional things I may like to do: 

- Make the endpoints interactive, so when this repo is forked/cloned and added to your local machine you'll be able to spin up the site locally and then search for the data you want. 
- Add custom engineering to pull in more specialized data for statistical analysis
- Visualization of data
- Export data to spreadsheets
- Add details for others to use this locally
